      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a software developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Anaheim, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Music has always been my passion, my favorite instruments are the piano, guitar and the concertina.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A dream job for me doesn't necessarily mean a situation like I absolutely have to be doing A, B and C. A dream job to me is simply just a job that I enjoy doing, working with people I like, and provides enough to live comfortably.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Anaheim, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Technology has always fascinated me since I was a young boy. I could spend hours infront of a television or video game console absolutely enamoured with the fact that something tangible, something I can touch, is sending signals to computers within the hardware that allow to play and have fun with some of my most cherished childhood games. The way the all the technology, all the boards, chips and controls; within both the controllers, console, and television worked in tandem to create a curated, fun experience; I think thats all nothing short of a miracle. I wanted to be a part of that world.  </p>
